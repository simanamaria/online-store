Online Store:
This is a Java project for an online store, implemented using a multimodular Maven project structure to keep the code organized and maintainable as new features were added.

Object-Oriented Design:
The store application was implemented using object-oriented design principles, with classes like Product, Category, Store, RandomStorePopulator, and StoreApp.

Cart and User System:
The store was extended to include a cart and user system, including functionality for users to add and remove items from their cart and checkout.

Performance Optimization:
To improve the performance of the application, multithreading was implemented to clear the cart after a certain amount of time and create separate threads to process orders. Design patterns were also applied where appropriate to improve the efficiency and maintainability of the code.

Testing:
Unit tests were written to cover all aspects of the project.

Database Connectivity:
The project implements database connectivity using the H2 database and Spring framework.

HTTP server:
An HTTP server was created in Java to handle categories and products, with the ability to store them in memory or a database. The server can process requests to add products to a cart and is secured with basic authentication. The client side was implemented using Spring.
